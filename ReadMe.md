# Lab 1 Assignment
Please write an R script that performs the operations described below.  When you are done, submit your assignment by uploading the actual R script itself to Canvas. Make sure the file you submit can be executed in R.  That is, make sure it will provide output using the source() command from within R.  Perform all the operations described below.  Comment your script so that I know which lines are meant to address which item in the list below.

1. Install R and R-Studio:
  * http://www.r-project.org 
  * http://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desk
  
2. Get the Data:
  * Inspect the data set for the lab (lab1.dat)
    * Are the column headers included in the file?
    * How are data columns separated?
    * Are there comments in the data?
  * Load that data file into a data frame in R directly from the web.  Pay special attention to the following parameters of read.table:
    * header=?
    * sep="?"
    * comment.char="?"
			
3. Peruse the Data:
  * Print the names of the variables in the data table (hint:  ?colnames)
  * Provide a global summary of the data table (hint: ?summary)
  
4. Investigate the WineType variable:
  * List all the values of the WineType variable in the data table
  * Compute the levels of that factor (hint: ?levels)
  * Compute the number of records of each level (hint: ?table)
  
5. Investigate the ColorIntensity variable:
  * Compute mean of the ColorIntensity variable  (hint:  ?mean)
  * Compute variance of the ColorIntensity variable  (hint: ?var)
  * Compute standard deviation of the ColorIntensity variable
  * Compute 95% confidence interval of the ColorIntensity variable
  (hint: ?t.test)
  
6. Investigate the Hue variable for WineType Class1:
  * Compute variance of the Hue variable across only the records with WineType=Class1 (hint: ?subset)
  * Compute standard deviation of the Hue variable across only the records with WineType=Class1
  * Compute 95% confidence interval of the Hue variable across
  * only the records with WineType=Class1
		
7. Perform simple math operations:
  * Subtract 120 from 536
  * Multiply 3 and 7
  * Divide 12 by 3
  * Take the base 2 logarithm of 128
  * Compute nine cubed
  
8. Perform math operations on data columns:
  * Compute the vector resulting from a pair-wise multiplication of all Hue variable values with ColorIntensity values
  * Sum the resulting vector from the previous step (hint:  ?sum)
  
9. Drawing random numbers:
  * Draw 10 numbers from the uniform distribution, between 0.0 and 10.0 (hint:  ?runif)
  * Draw 10 numbers from the Normal distribution, mean of 1.0, standard deviation of 0.3  (hint:  ?rnorm)
  * Compute PDF result for the standard Normal distribution at the value 0.12 (hint: ?dnorm)
  * Compute the probability that a value drawn from the standard
  * Normal distribution will be less than 1.96  (hint:  ?pnorm)
  
10. Simulation:
  * Perform a Monte Carlo sampling simulation of customers arriving at a queue over the period of 10 minutes, assuming this process is governed by the Poisson distribution and that 2 customers arrive per minute on average (hint:  ?rpois)
  * Compute the total number of people standing in line at each minute for one such simulation?  (hint: ?cumsum)
  * Enter the R code below, which defines a function.  Call that function using n=10, then again using n=10000, then again using n=10000000.  What does the function estimate?

```R
estimate <- function(n) {
  return (4*sum((runif(n)^2 + runif(n)^2) < 1)/n)
}
